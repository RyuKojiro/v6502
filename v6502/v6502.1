.Nm
is a fully functional virtual machine implementation of libv6502, with textmode video, keyboard input, and interactive debugger included.
The debugger has several commands, which can be listed by issuing the `help' command.
The debug prompt can also take assembly code, and will execute it in-place without incrementing the program counter.

You can specify a binary
.Ar image
to load by handing it in as an argument.
The
.Ar image
will be loaded at 0x0600, the default reset vector.
.Pp
On start,
.Nm
will load the
.Ar image
specified (if specified), and immediately start running from the reset vector. Upon encountering a BRK instruction, or recieving a SIGINT,
.Nm
will drop to the interactive debugger.
