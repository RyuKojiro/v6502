==================================== as6502 ====================================

NOTES:

When assembling from stdin, label parsing and dereferencing is not supported.
This is because the labels are all determined in advance on a first pass that
only cares about instruction size, and then the second pass actually begins
converting the assembly to machine code, while dereferencing the labels along
the way via the pre-built table.

DESIGN:

Pass 1:
	Reference calculation; conversion of variable names and labels to addresses.

Pass 2: (Final) (Only pass when using stdin)
	Handling of dot-prefix lines. Allocation of .data blocks, .words, .org.
	Conversion of instructions to machine code.

TODO:

* test.s:8: error: Invalid opcode '.org $e000'
	Needs to support . prefixed lines for special things like data, org, etc.
* test.s:54: error: Invalid opcode ';	as the first non-prime'
	Should ignore comment lines
